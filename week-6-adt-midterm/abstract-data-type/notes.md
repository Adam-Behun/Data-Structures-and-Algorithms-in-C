# Basic data structures

## Record

## Array
- stores an ordered list of items, items accessible by index
## Linked List
- stores an ordered list of items in nodes, each node has a pointer to the next node
## Binary Tree
- up to two children
## Hash Table
- unordered items by mapping each item to a location in an array
## Heap
- max-heap
- min-heap
## Graph
- represents connections among items
- vertex, edge


# Abstract data type (ADTs)
- These are created using the basic data structures

## List
- array or a linked list

## Dynamic Array
- allowing indexed access
- array

## Stack
- linked list
- items are only inserted or removed from the top of the stack

## Queue
- linked list
- items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue

## Deque
- linked list
- items can be isnerted and removed at both the front and back

## Bag
- array, linked list
- order does not matter and duplicate items are allowed

## Set
- Binary search tree, hash table
- distinct items

## Priority Queue
- heap
- queue where each item has a priority, items with higher priority are closer to the front of the queue

## Dictionary
- Hash table, binary search tree
- keys with values
