Recursion is useful because it is simpler to implement in many cases, however, it is usually considered worse in case of space and time complexity. 
This is because everytime we call the function in recursion the compiler needs to allocate resources for the whole function to run and 
also functions make copies of all the variables and that is an expensive operation.
Calling the same function again and again is simple to implement but slow because of those two reasons 
- function make copies and compiler needs to run the whole function again in recursion.
