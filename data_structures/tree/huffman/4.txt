Question 4

1. The tree is unique. Two people drawing the same Huffman coding table and tree can have two different designs.
2. Variable length-code which can mean slower computation. The codes have different lengths based on where they are in the tree
2. Continued = we might be able to solve the issue of Variable length code by using binary encoding
3. Another thing to see is that we need to know the frequency of each symbol in advance which is just not possible sometimes.
