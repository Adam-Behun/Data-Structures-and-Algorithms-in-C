Please find at least three applications for a Queue and explain why a Queue is used for that application.

Task scheduling in CPUs - queue is used here because the computer works on the tasks as they come in (First-in First-out). The CPU should be as utilized as possible and the tasks should be executed fairly - time and resources should be fairly allocated. 

Resource Allocations - For example in printers queues are used as we queue the jobs within the computer which then commands the docs to print in the order as they come ine

Batch processing - Apache Spark framework uses queue data structure to schedule the execution of the jobs held in a queue. It is far more complex and I do not yet understand it but queue would fit within this framework 

Message Buffering - the messages that the producers send are held in a queue before the received sees them. This can be all kinds of messages or signals that are transmitted between machines, not just "messages".
